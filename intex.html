The warm and juicy Jalebi, when combined with chilled rabri, is something that a person can kill for! But, do you know that this sweet dish that we have been enjoying for ages, is not Indian. As per the Oxford Companion, ‘Kitab-al-Tabeekh’, a cookbook by a Baghdadi author has the original recipe of this famous dessert that has several names to its credit. Apart from the fact that Jalebi is not Indian, it has been in existence for 500 years in India. Also, the very name Jalebi comes from a Sanskrit word ‘Jalvallika’ that means ‘full of water’. You will be surprised to know but Jalebi is known to cure headaches and cold when taken with warm milk in Northern India and Pakistan. This combination makes you feel warm and is enjoyed by many people in winters.

 <p>It is a 3-ingredient dessert prepared using gram flour, ghee, and sugar. It’s history dates back to the 17th or 18th century and is known to be a traditional South Indian sweet that finds relevance on special occasions and festivals. It is said that Kakasura Madappa, the head chef in the Royal Kingdom of Mysore in the reign of King Krishna Raja Wodeyar who made Mysore Pak for the first time. The story goes like this that the King was ready to have lunch, however, there was one spot vacant in his Thali. And so, Madappa quickly prepared a sweet dish using gram flour, ghee, and sugar and let it cool down. By the time, the King finished his meal and was looking for sweet, Madappa served him the cooled cake. The sweet melted in his mouth and the King wanted another one and then asked for its name. Madappa was so nervous at that time that he named it ‘Mysore Paka’,where ‘paka’ means a sweet concoction in Kannada. Soon, it was given the status of royal sweet and from there on the legacy continues

A trip to the famous Taj Mahal and no one comes empty handed. The trip to Agra is always accompanied by the translucent and delicious Pethas that can provide instant energy. These Pethas do taste yummy, but do you know that they originated in the royal kitchen of the Mughal Empire? It was Emperor Shah Jahan who ordered for a sweet to be made as white as the Taj Mahal. And as many as 500 workers were appointed to make Petha! Also, it is believed that Petha is as old as Taj Mahal as it was made for the 21,000 workers who were working on Taj Mahal to provide them with extra energy. Petha is often called God’s sweet, as it is considered as the purest sweetmeat ever made in the world. Reason? It is just made using pumpkin, sugar and of course water!

<p>
This soft and syrupy dessert is world famous as a Bengali dessert. There is no occasion or ceremony without the heavenly presence of Rasgulla. Made of chhena or the homemade cottage cheese, the original name of Rasgulla is Khira Mohana, and it is said to have its origin in Odisha. The legend that proves it is centuries old shows it to be the favourite of the Gods themselves. It is said that when Lord Jagannath was going for Rath Yatra, he didn’t bring his consort, Lakshmi. As expected, Lakshmi was upset and to pacify her, Lord Jagannath offered her Rasgulla. Since then, it’s a tradition to offer Rasgulla to Goddess Lakshmi on the ninth day of Rath Yatra to pacify her. Only after she has savoured the mithai, the three deities (Jagannath, Balaram, and Subhadra) can enter the temple.
